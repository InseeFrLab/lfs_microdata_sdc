## Content

I. Introduction : a roadmap to release microdata file  
    
    A. All the steps to follow  
        --TODO-- global scheme
    B. What to define before managing the data  

II. Monitoring the risk of disclose confidential data  - Theoretical part

    A. The trade-off between risk and information loss  

        1. Trade-off  
        2. Assessing the risk  
            *TODO* simple example of microdata on which assess th risk with each possible measure
        3. Assessing the Information Loss
            *TODO* example to illustrate how to do it

    B. Reducing the risk with some Satistical Disclosure Control (SDC) methods used by Office of National Statistics in Europe

        0. Suppressive vs Perturbative methods
            *TODO* Table summarizing the different ways to protect data
        1. Suppressive methods  
            a. Suppression, recoding or top coding of variables
            b. Local Suppression
        2. Perturbative methods (non exhaustive presentation)
            a. PRAM
            b. Noise addition
            c. Targeted Record Swapping
            d. Synthetic Data

III. Monitoring the risk of disclose confidential data  - Practical part
    
    A. How to do it in a proper way ? A proposition.

        1. Main steps to follow
        2. A tutorial on some simplified example
            *TODO* tutorial with an extract of RA LFS microdata

    B. French release of LFS microdata files

        1. Legal rules
        2. Public vs Researchers
        3. Public use files, Scientific use files and Secured use files
            *TODO* Table summarizing the structures of each file 
        4. Assessing the risk of LFS microdata Public Use File

IV. Audit of RA LFS microdata file released on the web

    A. Issues
    B. An example of R workflow to manage discosure risks on LFS microdata
        *TODO* a tutorial 
    C. Thinking together about a global strategy
    D. Initiating Implementation

V. (Optional) Further SDC Methods

VI. Further Questions and Debrief
